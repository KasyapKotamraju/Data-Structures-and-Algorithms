TO BE FOLLOWED IN THE INTERVIEWS

1. Don't directly jump into solving problems. First read the question thoroughly as some times we can get logic just by seeing the test cases and then ask all the clarifications needed from the solutions.
2. Few questions could be asked in an interview are 
    a. What is the size of input or range of input values ?
    b. Does the input contain negative numbers, zeros, duplicates ?
    c. Does the solution is unique or there could be multiple solutions ?
    d. What could be the extreme values of input ? (useful to handle edge and base cases) 
    e. If target does not exist what should we return (0 or -1) ?
3. Then discuss the naive solution and if that is accepted then start discussing about the optimal solution. If that too accepted start writing the code.
4. Anytime writing code part should take less time than the prior discussion. For that you need to make everything clear before starting writing code.
5. Keep all the projects that you have done to showcase to the interviewer.

TIPS ABOUT PATTERNS AND LOGICS

1. Problems statements which contains 'subarray' operations and 'array with target' can be solved using either TWO POINTERS APPROACH or 
SLIDING WINDOW TECHNIQUE.
